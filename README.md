# MainStreet

A community business succession platform that matches retiring small business owners with community-rooted buyers — veterans, immigrants, long-tenured employees, and first-generation owners. MainStreet solves both halves of the succession gap at once: sellers raise their **Transferability Score**, buyers raise their **Readiness Score**, and a matching engine pairs them on industry, geography, capital, values, and mentorship fit.

---

## Quick start (local dev)

```bash
# Requires Node 22+
npm run setup   # install all deps (root + client + server)
npm run dev     # API on :3001  ·  Vite client on :5173
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>.

For local demo data, run `npm run seed:dev` after setup. The seed command refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Demo accounts

Password for all: **`demo1234`**

| Role   | Email                              | Name             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Seller | `owner@mainstreet.com`             | Margaret Alvarez |
| Buyer  | `buyer@mainstreet.com`             | Marcus Reed      |

Four more seeded sellers (auto repair, landscaping, bookkeeping, hardware) and four more seeded buyers (immigrant entrepreneur, long-tenured employee, first-gen CPA, career changer from finance) with realistic match scores between them.

## Deploying to the web

### Option A — Render.com (recommended, easiest)

The `render.yaml` in this repo is configured for a production-style Render web service with a persistent disk for SQLite.

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to <https://render.com> → **New → Blueprint**.
3. Connect your repo — Render reads `render.yaml` automatically.
4. Click **Apply**. Render will:
   - Install deps and build the React app
   - Start the server (`npm start`)
   - Generate secure `JWT_SECRET` and `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` values
   - Mount a 1 GB persistent disk at `/data`
   - Store SQLite at `/data/mainstreet.db`

> **Persistence note:** Render services use an ephemeral filesystem by default. The blueprint uses the Starter plan because persistent disks are not available on the free web-service tier. If you want to stay on a free/trial service, use a managed database via `DATABASE_URL` instead of local SQLite.

### Option B — Railway.app

1. Push to GitHub.
2. <https://railway.app> → **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Add environment variables in the Railway dashboard:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=<generate a long random string>
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<generate a different long random string>
   DB_PATH=/data/mainstreet.db
   APP_URL=https://your-public-url
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=apikey
   SMTP_PASS=<your SMTP API key>
   EMAIL_FROM=MainStreet <your verified sender>
   ```
4. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data` for the database.
5. Railway reads `railway.json` for build/start commands automatically.

### Option C — Fly.io

```bash
# install flyctl first: https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/
fly auth login
fly launch          # picks up fly.toml, asks you to confirm settings
fly secrets set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
fly secrets set REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
fly volumes create mainstreet_data --size 1 --region ord
fly deploy
```

### Option D — Any VPS / Docker (coming soon)

You can run `npm run build && npm start` on any Linux server. Point `DB_PATH` to a persistent path and set `JWT_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `APP_URL`, and real SMTP settings. Works on DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Hetzner, etc.

## Environment variables

| Variable     | Required in prod | Default (dev)                   | Notes                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **Yes**          | insecure dev fallback           | Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET` | **Yes** | insecure dev fallback | Use a different generated value |
| `PORT`       | No               | `3001`                          | Most platforms set this automatically  |
| `NODE_ENV`   | No               | `development`                   | Set to `production` to enable SPA mode |
| `DB_PATH`    | No               | `server/db/mainstreet.db`       | Point to a persistent disk in prod     |
| `APP_URL`    | **Yes in prod**  | `http://localhost:5173`         | Public HTTPS URL used to build links in emails |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | **Yes in prod**  | `MainStreet <noreply@mainstreet.local>` | "From" header — must match your verified sender in SendGrid |
| `SMTP_HOST`  | **Yes in prod**  | _(unset → console fallback)_    | `smtp.sendgrid.net`                    |
| `SMTP_PORT`  | No               | `587`                           | Leave at 587 for SendGrid              |
| `SMTP_USER`  | **Yes in prod**  | —                               | Literal string `apikey` for SendGrid   |
| `SMTP_PASS`  | **Yes in prod**  | —                               | Your SendGrid API key (starts with `SG.`) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | No          | Local Vite origins in dev       | Comma-separated cross-origin browser origins |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local overrides (never commit `.env`).

> Without the SMTP vars, development logs would-be emails to stdout. Production startup refuses to continue until real email settings and a public HTTPS `APP_URL` are configured.

## Sending real email (SendGrid)

The app uses generic SMTP via nodemailer, so any SMTP provider works. SendGrid is the easiest free option (100 emails/day, no credit card). **You do not need to set up DNS or domain authentication** — Single Sender Verification is enough to start.

### One-time setup (5 minutes)

1. **Sign up** at <https://signup.sendgrid.com>.
2. **Verify a single sender.** SendGrid dashboard → **Settings → Sender Authentication → Verify a Single Sender**. Use an email address you control (your personal Gmail is fine). Click the verification link SendGrid emails you.
3. **Create an API key.** **Settings → API Keys → Create API Key** → name it `mainstreet-prod` → choose **Restricted Access** → grant **only** the "Mail Send" permission → copy the key (you only see it once — starts with `SG.`).
4. **Set env vars** in your host (Render dashboard → your service → Environment):
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=apikey
   SMTP_PASS=SG.your-api-key-here
   EMAIL_FROM=MainStreet <the-email-you-verified@example.com>
   APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
   ```
   `SMTP_USER` is the literal string `apikey`, not your username. `EMAIL_FROM` must use the exact address you verified in step 2 or SendGrid will reject the send.
5. Save — Render redeploys automatically. Register a test account on your live site; you should receive a verification email within seconds.

### Upgrading later: your own domain

When you have a real domain (e.g. `mainstreet.co`), redo Sender Authentication as **Domain Authentication** instead of Single Sender. That's the screen that asks you to paste CNAME records into your DNS — and it only works once you actually own the domain. Then change `EMAIL_FROM` to `MainStreet <hello@mainstreet.co>` and you're done.

### Troubleshooting

- **Emails not arriving:** check server logs. If you see `[email/console] Would have sent email`, your SMTP env vars aren't loaded. If you see an SMTP auth error, double-check `SMTP_USER=apikey` (literal) and that `SMTP_PASS` is the full key including the `SG.` prefix.
- **Emails landing in spam:** expected with Single Sender Verification because the From address (your Gmail) doesn't match the actual sender (SendGrid). Move to Domain Authentication on a real domain to fix.

## API reference

Protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Profile, match, mentor, and connection routes also require a verified email address.
